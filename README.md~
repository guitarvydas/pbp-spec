# Purpose
Working on describing PBP ("0D") in enough minute detail to allow an LLM (a Claude 4.0 "project") to generate code for it.

See (unfinished) `spec.md`.

Kibitzing and contributions would be appreciated, if you have the time to look at this.

# Method
I think this will turn into two major specifications:
1. A general specification of how PBP should work.
2. Custom specifications for 10 simple Parts that make up this example solution.

Presently, I think the this diagram represents what I want to do

# Background
I have been struggling to convert some 325 blog articles written in Obsidian to a format compatible with Github Pages.

I ask Claude 4.0 to generate code for this conversion, but after some 45 tries, the generated code still contained serious errors.

I decided to re-think and chunk the problem into smaller pieces ("divide and conquer") in the hopes of making the task so simple that even an LLM could generate correct code.

I found myself creating 10 chunks and drawing a diagram of how to connect the chunks in drawio.

## Issues
The main issues in this conversion project are:
- Obsidian encourages one to write articles in small chunks and to use "links" to recursively reference the chunks. Github Pages tends to want a big, flat file of markdown.
- Obsidian uses wiki-links, Github Pages uses older-style markdown links containing concrete relative pathnames.
